# Hack-a-Shaq

## Inspiration
We wanted to build something fun and interactive for this hackathon, making sure to stay close to the theme. Trivia is something that almost everyone enjoys so that's why we decided to make a quiz app! Since this was our first Hackathon we wanted to keep it relatively simple.

## What it does
Hack-a-Shaq (a pun on the phrase players would say about Shaquille O'Neal because of his lackluster free-throw shooting performance and the fact that we are in a HACK-athon....get it??) is a multi-choice quiz app that goes over common NBA trivia about the players and the games. It takes you through 20 questions and tells you your score at the end.

## How we built it
We used HTML, Sass, and JavaScript to build the app.

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we ran into was making sure the images showed up properly. We wanted the images to be formatted and displayed the right way and used to aid the user in choosing the correct answer.

Another challenge was changing the color of the text for the right and wrong answers once the user submits the quiz. We display green text for a correct answer and red text for a wrong answer. This was a challenge because the color had to be changed after everything was submitted and not after just a single question response.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the styling of our app. We tried to pay homage to our app name and make the design similar to a Miami Heat jersey. We tried to make everything readable and appealing so we used the font created by the Braille institute.
We are also proud of the questions we displayed. We tried to make some more difficult than others and we tried to keep them varied so that a seasoned NBA watcher would enjoy using the app.

## What we learned
We learned how to make a quiz app from scratch using just vanilla JavaScript. We learned how to make an interactive site and bettered our skills in formatting web pages. We also learned more JavaScript by creating the logic for the quiz.

## What's next for Hack-a-Shaq
We hope to expand our development skills, beyond quiz apps and beyond web development. We are all still in school, so we hope to use what we learn in our education to help us build exciting programs. Maybe we can work together again and make a full-stack project using a professional framework/library like React in the future. We also would like to make it more interactive by including some of the other jersey colors and perhaps a live chatroom for games so that people can get together and talk to people while watching.
